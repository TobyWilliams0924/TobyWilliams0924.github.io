                Hi, I'm Toby Williams. I'm 30 years old and diving headfirst into the exciting world of cybersecurity. My interest in this field dates back to high school, where I got into a bit of trouble for tinkering with computers. I used to change root passwords on my friends' machines and disable the website blocks that were put in place. Those early adventures sparked a deep curiosity and passion for understanding and securing digital environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I'm channeling that curiosity into a career. I believe that the same enthusiasm that led me to explore and push boundaries as a teenager can drive me to become a skilled and innovative cybersecurity professional. I'm eager to contribute to the field and protect the systems and data that are so crucial in today's world.
